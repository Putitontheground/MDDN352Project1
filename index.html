                    HeTohuAr is an AR Experience that allows visitors to explore information about women's suffrage in a exciting mobile interactive way. I wanted to explore ways in bringing this piece of NZ history out of the library and into people's pockets. 

                    I took inspiration from previous museum visits where QR codes were in use but only in a reading or video watching sense. The AR experience is another level of interactivity which feels perfect for the celebration of this historic event.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With the help of QR codes and AR technology my site will bring a fun interactive experience to anyone who has access to a mobile that allows them to explore interesting information about the women's suffrage movement in New Zealand.

                        The experience will be quick, easy and won’t require the installation of 3rd party apps like many other AR experiences do. I plan to use AR.js in my site which uses QR codes and markers to bring an augmented reality experience to your mobile. Markers which contain QR codes can be placed around the library or the city can bring the experience to you and display information relevant to your location.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Users will discover markers like this one in various locations and scan them with their phone once picked up by the phone a link will display showing and once camera access is allowed they will have mobile AR (The Hiro marker is the default marker, however these are customisable, the He Tohu marker will be the output). The AR scene display could vary from displaying an AR map with the locations around you where the petition was signed, to a log representing how much wood the petition was made out of.

                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Each QR marker requires a different QR code but the marker stays the same, this is important as users will be able to recognise the marker anywhere. 
                        The example picture shows the AR scene, the object shown is just an abstract form, it is possible to upload more detailed models to the site.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The info blurb that will display down the bottom of the device will allow users to explore further about this important piece of New Zealand history. It can be continuously expanded on as the amount of QR markers that can be placed is limitless. This project is very versatile and could also be applied to other exhibitions or spaces that are looking for an interactive and interesting way to show their content.

                    <p>The design will stay simple and lightweight, the user experience will stay simple with minimal clicks between the start and finish. Over the top of the live camera feed in browser there will be a small window containing information which is expandable and contains links for further reading on the topic. This condenses the experience into a lightweight package which is perfect for what visitors want.</p>  <br><br>
